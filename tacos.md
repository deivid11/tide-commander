# Tacos: A Complete Guide

## History

Tacos are a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat-based tortilla topped with various fillings. The origins trace back to ancient Mexico, long before Spanish colonization.

### Ancient Origins

- Maize has been domesticated in Mexico for at least 9,000 years
- One of the first uses of ground maize was the tortilla (flatbread made of maize, ground lime, and water)
- Ancient Mexicans filled soft corn tortillas with fish, cooked organs, and other local ingredients
- Pre-Spanish taco fillings included reptiles (snakes, iguanas), native mammals, birds (armadillos, turkeys), and insects (grasshoppers)

### Etymology

Two main theories exist for the word "taco":
1. Mexican silver miners used the term for explosive charges in plug form (paper wrapper with gunpowder filling)
2. Derives from the Nahuatl word "tlahco" meaning "half" or "in the middle"

### Introduction to the United States

- First introduced to the US in 1905 by Mexican migrants working on railroads
- Food carts in Los Angeles run by "chili queens" sold soft corn tortilla tacos
- The pre-fried U-shaped taco shell was invented in the 1940s
- Glen Bell (Taco Bell founder) popularized hard shell tacos in the 1950s
